Cookies downloaded by one Container are not available to other Containers. You can even integrate individual Containers with Mozilla VPN to protect your browsing and location. With the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, you can...\n\n    Sign in to two different accounts on the same site (for example, you could sign in to work email and home email in two different Container tabs.\n    Keep different kinds of browsing far away from each other (for example, you might use one Container tab for managing your Checking Account and a different Container tab for searching for new songs by your favorite band)\n    Avoid leaving social-network footprints all over the web (for example, you could use a Container tab for signing in to a social network, and use a different tab for visiting online news sites, keeping your social identity separate from tracking scripts on news sites)\n    Protect your browsing activity in individual Containers using Mozilla VPN, so you can shop while travelling abroad but check your bank account from a server in your home country.\n\n\nAfter installing the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, click the Containers icon to edit your Containers.

Every time you open a new window or tab, you'll be greeted by this minimalist looking page that will help your serenity and productivity. Thanks to its gorgeous high quality backgrounds that change according to the mood of the day, your new tabs will always feel fresh.\n\nBonjourr was built as a more modern alternative to homepages like Momentum. We took inspiration from iOS and Apple's design language to create this beautiful homepage that will help you focus on what matters.\n\nHere's some key features:\n🍏 iOS design language\n🏞 Dynamic 4K backgrounds that change according to the mood of the day\n⚡️ Fast & lightweight!\n🔎 Search bar (compatible with all search engines)\n🕰 Analog clock with multiple clock faces\n🌤 Weather\n🔗 Quick Links\n👋 Greets you by your name\n🌘 Dark mode\n🥖 Emoji as favicon\n🧑‍💻 Custom CSS styling\n📝 Custom fonts\n🔒 Privacy focused\n🌎 Multilanguage\n\nBonjourr aims to look and feel minimal, while still bringing you lots of options to customise it to your liking. Set your own backgrounds (or Unsplash collections!), enable the beautiful analog clock, set your own font and Quick Links... You can even check out our documentation where we compiled some style snippets to do even more.\n\nThe project is entirely open source, developer friendly and actually respects your privacy. We do not collect any data, nor do you need to create an account to use it.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n🏞 Dynamic 4K backgrounds\nWe handpicked some of the most beautiful Unsplash photos so that your new tabs will always feel fresh. Discover high quality photos of incredible landscapes, animals and nature.\n\n⚡️ Fast & lightweight!\nBonjourr is built with vanilla JavaScript and optimised for the best possible performance.\n\n🔎 Search bar\nThe integrated search bar of Bonjourr is compatible with all search engines. Yes, all of them! That includes the usual Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, Startpage as well as others, like Ecosia, Lilo and Qwant. If you want, you can even add you own custom search engine.\n\n🕰 Analog clock\nBonjourr's default clock is made to ressemble what you have on the iPhone and other iOS devices. But if you'd like something more exotic, you can replace it with a very cool analog clock, and customise it as you'd like.\n\n🌤 Weather\nIn a simple sentence, get a summary of you local current weather and forecast.\n\n🔗 Quick Links\nIt wouldn't be a real homepage without bookmarks! Bonjourr allows you to add your own bookmarks, change their icons and import your current bookmarks from your browser.\n\n🌘 Dark mode\nJust like on iOS, Bonjourr has a beautiful automatic dark mode.\n\n🥖 Emoji as favicon\n\n🔒 Privacy focused\nSome homepages like Momentum encourage you to create an account, give them some personal info, use more permissions and rely on many third party services. Bonjourr doesn’t collect any data, even for analytics purposes, use minimal permissions, rely on fewer third party services and of course doesn’t have any account system. Bonjourr being open source also means that you can easily check out if our claims are true.\n\n🧑‍💻 Custom CSS styling\nHave a specific idea in mind? Bonjourr has you covered with the custom styles section. You can customise and do anything when you add your own CSS.\n\n📝 Custom fonts\nWant a specific font on your homepage ?
